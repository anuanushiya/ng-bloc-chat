# Angular Bloc Chat
A single page web application implemented in HTML5, CSS, AngularJS, and using Firebase as a back-end database for storing information about rooms, users, and chats. The app was built as a project as part of Bloc's [Frontend Web Development](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp) coding bootcamp.

The app allows multiple users to simultaneously chat and manage chat rooms in realtime. For more information and demo see my [portfolio](http://developer.textlogic.ch/portfolio/2-bloc-chat.html).

## Starting the app
Bloc Chat runs with a starter application using the `grunt` build tool and `npm`. The easiest way to run Bloc Chat is to download and install these dependencies. More information can be found in the [starter application](https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter) repository.

Using the app is straightfoward---just sign in with a user name, select a room, and chat away.
